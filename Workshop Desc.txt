[h1][b] This mod is still a work in progress. If you discover missing or incorrect skins, report them. [/b][/h1]

I present to you, Gunsmith Reloaded - Appearance Expansion (GSR-AE for short), an addition to the regular Gunsmith Reloaded addon that aims to offer as many of the original CS:GO skins for all applicable weapons as possible, all through the power of ARC9 and its universal attachment systems.

[h1]NOTE[/h1]
[i]All of the skins are converted to GMod as-is and will not have any texture alterations. If a skin looks weird or incorrect in-game, or is missing entirely, that's because it was either a pain to get right, or impossible to do, or perhaps just forgotten.[/i]
[i]If you are looking for a list of what skins are included, refer to the discussion page called "Included Skins". It details if it's included or incorrectly done on purpose.[/i]
[i]Remember that when using these skins, many weapon attachments will look incorrect. That is because of the base, not GSR or GSRAE.[/i]

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
- [b]How do I equip them?:[/b] When in the customization screen, click on [b]PERSONALIZE[/b], then [b]Skins[/b], then [b]CS:GO Skins[/b] and then select the category and skin you want to use!
- [b]Do i require anything else to use this:[/b] You'll need the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2910505837]ARC9 base[/url] and of course [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2910537020]Gunsmith Reloaded[/url].
